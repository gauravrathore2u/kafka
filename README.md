-> Kafka has topics, Each topic has partitions.

-> we can have consumer groups, these consumer groups can have many consumers.

-> One consumer can consume many partitions BUT two consumers can not try to consume one partition in a single Consumer group.

-> we can use kafka as Queue ans pubsub both,
-> in Queue we have one producer and one consumer, In PubSub we have one producer and many consumer.

--> Using as Queue:- If no. of partition = no. of consumers then it each partition will have its consumer i.e. it will work like a queue
